**Data** has **data objects** that consist of **data attributes**.
- **Attributes** are variables that describe all sorts of things. (ex. student ID, age, sex, grades, etc.)
	- **Attribute values** are numbers/symbols assigned for a single data attribute
	- The way you measure an attribute may not match the attribute properties.
		- Assume you have multiple genders, "Male" "Female" "Prefer not to say". In a database they can be listed as 1, 2, or 3 as codes. It doesn't mean that those items have inherent order, they're just listed as numbers to save space.
	- Types of attributes:
		- **Nominal** - numbers
		- **Ordinal** - has rankings
		- **Interval** - calendar dates, temperatures
		- **Ratio** - temperatures in Kelvin, length, time, counts
		- ![[Pasted image 20260131074713.png]]
	- **Asymmmetric** - typically associated with sets
		- Association analysis
		- Only presence is important
	- **Types of data sets**
		- Record - tabular
		- Graph - nodes & edges
		- Ordered - spatial data, tempora data, sequential data

**NOTE!** Data can be either segmented, have relationships, have structure, or be incomplete. You have to clean the data for this

Data matrix - can be represented as n rows and m columns
Document data - each document becomes a 'term' vector, where the value of each component is the number of times it appears.
Transaction data - each record involves a set of items
