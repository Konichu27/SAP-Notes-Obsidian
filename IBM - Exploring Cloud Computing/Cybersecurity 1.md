- **CIA** - Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
- Threat model
- Belle-LaPedulla model:
	- Users should not "read-up" or "write-down" clearance levels
	- Read up - lower-clearance should not read higher-clearance
	- Write down - higher-clearance should not edit lower-clearance
		- This prevents accidental leakage of higher-clearance data
- **Canaries** - unused buffer space used to detect buffer attacks
