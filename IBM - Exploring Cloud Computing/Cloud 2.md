### Benefits of Cloud Computing
- **Flexibility** - can fit a variety of needs and constraints
- **Efficiency** - quick and out-of-the-box
- **Strategic value** - up-to-date technology

### Examples of Uses of Cloud
- **SaaS** - for consumer use
	- Accessing personal files & specific applications
	- Ex. Gmail, GDrive, G-Suite, iTunes, Adobe Cloud, etc.
- **PaaS** - for developers
	- Testing and access becomes much easier as they're not the ones directly managing the infrastructure
- **IaaS** - for businesses
	- Very specific services such as pay-as-you-go storage, networking, servers, and virtualization
	- IT infrastructure that a business needs can be covered by the cloud instead of having to set it up on their own

### Examples of Cloud Computing Roles
- **Cloud architect** - oversees a company's approach in cloud computing
- **Cloud engineer** - manages the implementation of cloud services (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, etc.)
