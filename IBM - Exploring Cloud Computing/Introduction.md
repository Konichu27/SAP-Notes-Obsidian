- **Cloud computing** - digital services provided on the internet, instead of onsite
- Advantages of cloud computing:
	1. **Better storage & processing** for massive amounts of data
	2. **Accessibility** for any Internet-connected device
- **Cloud service provider** - provides IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS
	- **IaaS** - borrows network, storage, components
	- **PaaS** - borrows cloud-provided environments for app development
		- Ex. containers, databases, runtime, integration, etc.
		- Ex. Vercel, AWS
	- **SaaS** - file management
		- Software and data both reside online. No special software is needed.
	- **XaaS** - "anything as a service"
	-

- **Virtualization** - allows multiple OSes on a single machine
	- **Physical server** - Hard drive/memory bank devoted to one group of users or one type of data
	- **Virtual server** - A "software-controlled region" of a physical server
		- i.e. a physical server can be divided into multiple virtual servers
	- **VMs** - different network interfaces, memory, storage, etc. on the same machine

### Types of Clouds
- **Public clouds** - for consumer use
	- Easy to scale
	- Under "multi-tenant architecture" (as many users are using one large cloud platform)
- **Private cloud** - for a single organization
	- Can be managed either by the org itself or the cloud service provider
	- Has different scalability requirements (expands only when it needs to)
- **Hybrid cloud** - public & private resources
