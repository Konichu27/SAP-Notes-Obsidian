- **Artificial intelligence** - machines with capabilities usually associated with human intelligence
- **Machine learning** - a discipline about using algorithms to learn from data
	- Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning
- **Deep learning** - uses artificial neural networks (ANNs)
	- Requires big data, enormous computing power

**Turing test** - originally formally defined by the following parameters:
- A room of judges communicate with a group of participants who communicate solely by keyboard. Some of the participants are AI
- If the AI participants can fool the judges into passing as a human, they pass the test
- Or, more formally: if one of the players can be replaced by an AI without substantially changing the results or assumptions made by the judges
- Early conversational AI: ELIZA, PARRY, Eugene Goostman
- The Turing test was a huge struggle due to the complexity of natural language

### Types of AI
- **Weak AI** - for narrow tasks
	- Ex. chatbots, virtual assistants, facial recognition, AI recommendations
- **Augmented intelligence** - supplements human decision-making
	- Ex. IBM Watson -> suggesting possible treatments and their effectiveness, with the health professional determining the final decision
- **General AI** - "whole brain emulation"
	- Does not yet exist

### Other Terms
- **Algorithms** - instructions for a specific problem
- **Chatbot** - computer program that talks to humans
- **Data** - allows AI to infer decisions
	- Either structured (database, spreadsheet) or unstructured (tweets, PDFs, video files)
- **Machine learning** - the "engine of an AI system"
- **Deep learning** - used to find patterns in complex data structures like images, video, sound
	- Most models do not need explicit training, making them excellent for all sorts of purposes
- **Neural networks** - ML that imitates the human brain
	- Neurons/perceptrons
	- Data is fed into multiple layers of neurons, which are then propagated into an output and then back after labeling
	- Inherently a "black box" model since it creates inferences without clear cause or explainability, but are excellent in discovering complex relationships
- **Reinforcement learning** - ML that requires no data at all
	- Instead, reward signals are given for correct actions
- **Supervised learning** - labeled data
- **Unsupervised learning** - unlabeled data
	- AI suggests ways to organize or cluster data
- **Natural language processing** - understanding human language in general, whether written or spoken
- **Speech recognition** - used to recognize words that convert to text or actions
	- **Voice recognition**
- **Intelligence augmentation**
