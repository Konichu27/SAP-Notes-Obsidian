- Also known as **extensibility**

### Four Principles of Extensions 
- Extensions should be **avoided** as much as possible
- Extensions should be **decoupled**.
	- Three ways of implementing extensions:
		  - **On-stack** in SAP S/4HANA Cloud
			  - **Type 1** - Key user extensions
			  - **Type 2** - Developer extensions
		  - **Type 3** - **Side-by-side** in SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP)
	- Only released APIs and extension points are allowed. Non-released objects cannot be used.
- Extensions must be **cloud-compliant**.
	- ABAP Cloud Development Model
	- Clean Core Extensibility Frameworks
- **Upgrades** should not break extensions, and vice versa
- Should work w/ **tech stack** as well as SAP BTP
