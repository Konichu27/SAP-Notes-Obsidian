### Business Processes
- Keep competitiveness while reducing complexity
- **Elements in clean core business processes:**
	1. **Strong organizational structure** - clear roles & responsibilities
	2. **Robust technical foundation** - right tools & technologies
	3. **Transformation methodology** - clear, repeatable processes (in a meta sense)
	4. **Business process hierarchy** - categorizing and sorting business processes based on strategic importance & regulations
		- Afterwards, they are segmented into the following views:
			- **End-to-end process** - entire data flow within the company
			- **Functional process** - specific tasks
	5. **Align to-be process design and technical realization**
		- According to best practices, a *central authority* can be established regarding this so that all processes are standardized & consistent
