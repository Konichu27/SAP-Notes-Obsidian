**Sales order** - a *contractual agreement* between a sales organization and a business partner ('*sold-to party*')
- Includes customer data, product information, delivery data, quantity, shipping info, billing info
- Handled for every customer
- The foundation of the sales process
### Procedure/Workflow
- This is also known as **SAP Sales and Distribution (SD)**
1. **Sales document** is drafted for the sales order
	- Ordered product, quantity, delivery date
	- Includes shipping & billing
2. A **requirement** is triggered for materials management
	- If available, dates and quantities must be confirmed
	- If not, a **replenishment process** is triggered and the sales representative/customer is notified
3. After production, a **delivery** is created
4. Finally, a **goods issue** is posted in materials, management, and invoicing
	- When invoicing or posting a goods issue, *the posting in accounting is done automatically*

![[Pasted image 20260201020649.png]]
1. **Header** - document number and customer data
2. **Item** - individual data
3. **Schedule line** - confirmed quantities, date of delivery
	- May have multiple schedule lines, ex. possibly due to partial deliveries

### Sales Order Sourcing
- Either directly from stock or through in-house production

### Views
- The sales department also has two views:
	- **Sales: Sales Organization** - for sales organization + distribution channel
	- **Sales: General/Plant Data** - for delivery plant
