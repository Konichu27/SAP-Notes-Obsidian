	- **Planned independent requirements (PIR)** - stock requirements that are fulfilled in advance of sales orders
		- Used in make-to-stock planning
		- Usually require market research and forecasting
2. **Material requirements planning (MRP)**
3. **Procurement**

### In SAP S4/HANA...
**Product master record**
- The *most centralized* object in the ERP department
- Also known as *material master record*
- Pertains to a singular product
- Used by all departments; each department creates specific information for the same record
- Meanwhile, there is also *basic data* that is viewed by everyone and only maintained once
- Example:
	- Raw material records
	- Semi-finished material records
	- Finished material records
	- Things to consider: amount of raw material, time of manufacturing

### Types of Production in S4/HANA
- **Make-to-order** - materials are created on-demand exclusively for sales order items, instead of stocking general customer items in advance 
- **Make-to-stock** - products are made based on anticipated demand instead of make-to-order
