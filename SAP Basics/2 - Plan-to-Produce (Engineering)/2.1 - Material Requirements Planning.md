### Steps in MRP
1. **BOM explosion and scheduling**
	- **Bill of materials (BOM)** - list of materials needed for a product
		- Hence, *explosion* is the creation of list of components (exploding it)
		- Each assembled part is drilled down into raw materials until only raw materials are left
		- **Backward scheduling** then calculates the date needed for each raw material, wherein the following questions are asked:
			- When will final production take place?
			- When are components required?
			- When does procurement begin?
			- ![[Pasted image 20260131183204.png]]
			- ex. for a product, raw materials will be needed earlier, then assemblies later
2. **Net requirements calculation** - calculation of net requirements in case of shortages or problems
	- Compares the *sum of all receipts* with the *sum of all requirements*
	- Accomplished using **MRP Run**
	- **Replenishment elements** - procurements or assemblies to be done
		- *Procurement* is done through **purchase requisitions**, processed by the Materials *Management Department*
		- *Manufacturing* is done through **planned orders**, which are converted into **production orders**, processed by the *Production Department*
