- Aside from the base financial & management accounting, accounts payable accounting is used to record relationships with suppliers.
	- This includes purchase orders, goods receipts, and invoice receipts; these are overall related to logistics
- **G/L** - General Ledger Accounting
- **FI-AP** - Accounts payable accounting
- **LO-MM** - Material management
- Again, G/L invovles collective postings, where data is recorded in subledgers that connect back to G/L
- *Payments are typically automated*, but you can post (i.e. create) manual payments as well
	- Payment method, bank, items for payment, and payment amount are all needed

### Types of Data

**General data** - include vendor details, including contacts and location
- Maintained at the client level, so no need to define separate codes for each
- Each code can have different financial accounting settings, ex. different VAT
**Financial accounting data** - maintained at the company code level
- Includes correspondence, G/L accounting links, payment methods

(note: these seem to be switched up in the SAP site lol)

**NOTE!** In supplier payment in SAP Fiori, you **create an invoice first** and then **post an outgoing payment**. Then in the supplier line items card, you can see which payments have been cleared or not after searching
