### Management Accounting
- Financial data integrates tightly with SAP, allowing for easy understanding of cost structures & process margins
	- Also includes logistics & HR data
	- Analyses include: overhead cost controlling, product cost controlling, and profitability analysis

### Types of Costs
- **Primary costs** - typical expense or revenue postings
- **Secondary costs** - costs from facility management
	- Recorded in G/L accounts called **secondary cost accounts**

### Management Accounting in SAP
- **Cost object** - an item that represents a cost(?) (NOTE: Go back to this, I just guessed the definition from the courses)
	- Ex. a sales or production order for a bike or bike parts
	- Ex. Overhead cost control
		- All costs related to overhead control (like an ad campaign) are linked to a single cost object
	- Can be linked to *assignment objects*
	- Occurs w/ product costs, records control, and cost monitoring
	- The final output can be compared with the planned costs
- **Planned costs** - outcome of product cost planning
	- The estimation of product cost needed to create a minimum sale price
- **Margin analysis** - analyzes cost & revenue data to assess performance

(note: **FI** = Financial Accounting, **CO** = Controlling/Management Accounting)


#### ADDITIONAL NOTE:
![[Pasted image 20260131150239.png]]
A single journal entry typically represents a single transaction. It looks like this.
Most of the SAP Fiori interface is navigating through the various ledgers, where you can see journal entries.

In this case, Management Accounting can easily link to the journal entry in the G/L (finance accounting). In the past before S/4 HANA, these were separate tables that synced together.
- The single table that now links both these costs is called **ACDOCA**
