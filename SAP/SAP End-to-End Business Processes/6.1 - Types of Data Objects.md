# Objects
- The entities or structures that refer to data.
- Recall your Data Mining course. **Data objects** are subdivided into **attributes** (i.e. the columns in a relational database)

# Three Types of Objects
| **Object Type**        | **Definition**                                                       | **Purpose in SAP**                                                | **Key Characteristics**                                                                                                                                   | **Enterprise Structure Assignment**                                                              | **Examples**                                                                               |

> [!NOTE] Example of master data
> Imagine you are creating a new account for a shopping website, and you input your name, address, credit card details, etc.
> This is already **master data**. The next time you make a purchase, this master data is automatically populated again.

Additional info:
- Sales data -> assigned by distribution chains
- Warehouse data -> managed by WMS

Sales orders/documents must always be assigned to a sales area. Company code is automatically populated.

There are also separate customer master numbers, that refer to customer master data.

Each sales order also has a different document number
