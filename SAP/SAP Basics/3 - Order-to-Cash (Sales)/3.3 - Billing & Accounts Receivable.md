- **Sold-to party** - your customer
- In billing, customer invoices & credit notes are automatically sent to the accounts receivable ledger after the billing is posted
	- i.e. there is integration between sales & finance
	- Other general ledgers can also be updated depending on the transaction
- **Master record** is needed for the customer invoice

- A **Business Partner** is a specific type of user in SAP S/4HANA. You can assign roles to the Business Partner, such as 'FI Customer' if they are involved in Accounts Receivable.
- The *master record* can then be created with general data & financial accounting data (as discussed before). The base FA data are as follows:
	- **Reconciliation account** - remember, reconciliation is verifying that financial data reconciliates with external documents/subsidiary ledgers
	- **Payment terms**
	- **Dunning terms** - overdues

1. **Goods issue** is pushed to materials management
2. An **accounting document** is generated in **EFI**
3. A **billing document** is created to SD

	- In accounting, *billing is done once revenue is recorded*

- S4/HANA automatically defines due dates as well as dunning.
	- Dunning run is when one customer or multiple or all applicable customers are notified of overdues
	- Dunning levels can also be assigned
