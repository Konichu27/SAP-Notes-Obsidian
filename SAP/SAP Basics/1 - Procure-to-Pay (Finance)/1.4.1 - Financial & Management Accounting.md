### Types of Ledgers and Accounts
- **General ledger (G/L)** - main ledger, the most important ledger in the SAP system as it contains the master data
- **Reconciliation accounts** - pushes updates in subsidiary ledgers (smaller ledger) to the G/L
	- **Account reconciliation** - reviewing and comparing recorded transactions with external documents, like bank statements and receipts.
		- i.e. *Reconciling* your account with other docus
- Subsidiary ledgers:
	- **Accounts payable** - Owed *by* the business, i.e. incoming invoices or outgoing payments.
		- For example, Supplier invoices raise the liabilities G/L and the balance sheet
	- **Accounts receivable** - Owed *to* the business, i.e. incoming payments & other customer receivables.
		- Each customer account is linked to G/L Accounting.
		- For example, income payments reduce the receivables on the customer account, the G/L total receivables, and the balance sheet
	- **Asset accounting** - for assets
	- All of these subsidiary ledgers go to the balance sheet, which record assets and liabilities + equity.
	- Profit and loss accounts are recorded (revenue, profit, expenses, losses) but on a separate ledger

### Accounting in SAP S4/HANA
- SAP allows for each step of the accounting process to be traceable in real-time w/ individual documents
- G/L accounts are structured in a "**Chart of Account**" in SAP. The standard one is **YCOA**
- The G/L is made up of **Financial Statements**. Each company code allows only specific types of accounts, which are then structured in the Financial Statement
- Additionally, Financial Statements have many different versions depending on the country & business
