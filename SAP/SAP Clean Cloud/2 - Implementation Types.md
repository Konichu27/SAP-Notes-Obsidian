### Types of SAP Systems
- SAP S/4HANA **Cloud**
	- **Public Edition**
	- **Private Edition**
- SAP S/4HANA **On Premise**

**Greenfield** - new installation
- Clean slate, no limitations
**Brownfield** - system conversion
- Does not involve **Public Edition**
- **NOTE!** Unless explicitly stated, terminology that refers to private edition automatically also refers to on-premise solutions
- Either involves:
	- **Reusing**/in-place conversion
	- **Re-engineering** - **selective data transition**
		- consolidating data from multiple ERP systems
			- Often happens with companies that have merged

**Greenfield** allows for a clean core right from the beginning. **Brownfield** conversions, however, require decisions to *retain*, *eliminate*, or *transform* certain business processes.
